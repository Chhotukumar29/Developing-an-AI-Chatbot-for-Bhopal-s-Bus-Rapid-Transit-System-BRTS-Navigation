# AI Chatbot for Bhopal's Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) Navigation

## **Challenge Background**

Bhopal's ongoing urban growth demands an improved public transport system, and the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) is crucial in addressing this need. The red buses serve as an essential part of the city’s transit network. However, navigating the BRTS can be a challenge, especially for commuters unfamiliar with the local language or those new to the city.

The primary issue arises when passengers face confusion about routes, schedules, and ticketing procedures. This is especially difficult for first-time users, tourists, or non-native speakers. To overcome these barriers, we propose the development of an **AI-powered chatbot** that can assist in real-time, guiding users through the BRTS network.

The chatbot will offer support in multiple languages, primarily **Hindi**, and aim to provide:
- **Step-by-step navigation** for using BRTS
- **Accurate bus schedules** and traffic updates
- **Real-time assistance** for smoother and more efficient commutes

The ultimate goal is to reduce confusion, enhance user experience, and promote the use of public transport, contributing to sustainable urban mobility in Bhopal.

## **Goal of the Project**

The main objective of this project is to create an AI-powered chatbot for navigating Bhopal’s BRTS. Key features will include:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding and responding in multiple languages, especially **Hindi**.
- **Real-time bus schedules** and **traffic updates**.
- **Guidance on ticket purchasing** and **route navigation**.
- A user-friendly interface that will assist **tourists, first-time users**, and **non-native speakers**.

This project aims to:
1. **Improve the commuter experience**.
2. **Encourage more people to use the BRTS**.
3. Contribute to **sustainable urban mobility** in Bhopal.
