# Developing-an-AI-Chatbot-for-Bhopal-s-Bus-Rapid-Transit-System-BRTS-Navigation

## Challenge Background

With its ongoing expansion, the need for an improved public transport system in Bhopal parallels its growth. The red buses are an important part of the city's transit network and are part of the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) that serves the area. While the BRTS is crucial for most commuters, many face problems owing to not knowing about the routes or the local language, leading to confusion and inefficiency.

If you are not familiar with the local language or new to the city, navigating BRTS routes can be a challenging task. This problem impacts first-time users as well as tourists and non-native speakers who might struggle to grasp schedules, routes and procedures for purchasing tickets.

We propose implementing an AI-based chatbot equipped with NLP to solve these problems. This chatbot will provide real-time suggestions in various languages, including Hindi, to assist users in effortlessly navigating the BRTS. The chatbot aims to improve the commuting experience through step-by-step navigation, accurate bus schedules and traffic updates and ultimately will lead to a higher usage of public transportation. This solution aims to make it more accessible and decrease confusion while acting on the urban growth of Bhopal in a sustainable manner.

## Goal of the Project
This project aims to create an AI-powered chatbot that can guide commuters using Bhopal's Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) in real time. The chatbot will be able to support many languages, primarily Hindi, thanks to its natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, which will make it usable by a wide variety of users. The chatbot's objectives are to improve the user experience, encourage more usage of the BRTS, and help Bhopal's urban mobility by providing step-by-step instructions, real-time bus schedules, and traffic status updates.
